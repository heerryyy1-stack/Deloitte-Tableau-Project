# Deloitte Data Analytics Project with Tableau

### Project Overview

This project is a virtual experience program by Deloitte Australia. The task was to analyze telemetry data from a software called Daikibo using *Tableau*, a powerful business intelligence tool. The goal was to build a dashboard that visualizes key metrics, such as machine downtime, to provide actionable insights.

### Key Tasks Performed

- *Data Import:* Downloaded and imported a .json telemetry dataset into Tableau.
- *Calculated Fields:* Created a new calculated field called "Unhealthy" to represent potential downtime, assigning a value of 10 for every unhealthy status.
- *Data Visualization:*
  - Created a bar chart showing **Downtime Per Factory**.
  - Created a new sheet with a bar chart visualizing **Downtime Per Device Type**.
- *Dashboard Creation:* Combined the two charts into a single dashboard.
- *Interactivity:* Set up the first chart (Downtime Per Factory) as a *filter*, allowing users to select a specific factory to view the corresponding downtime of devices within it.

### Tools Used

- *Tableau:* For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- *JSON Data:* The source data format for the project.

### Project Learnings

This project helped me gain practical experience in:
- Connecting to and preparing data in Tableau.
- Creating calculated fields to derive new insights from raw data.
- Designing interactive and user-friendly dashboards.
- Applying data analytics skills to a real-world businessÂ problem.
